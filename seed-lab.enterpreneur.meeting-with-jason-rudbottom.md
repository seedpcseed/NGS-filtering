# Meeting with Jason Rubottom

\#jason-rubottom #SMCRI #microbiome

**Meeting purpose**: discuss microbiome projects for commercial development

### Current technologies

1\.** Overcoming antibiotic resistancetance** [[Engineered organisms to combat antibiotic resistance]]

- Antibiotic resistance is a major problem. Rates are rising and antibiotics are becoming useless
- Resitance is primarily the result of exposure to the reseroirs of microbes aka the microbiota.  
- When exposed, microbes respond to antibiotic stress by increasing mutation rates and increasing transfer of genes between microbes. These changes can result in rare transfer or inheritance of antimicrobial resistance. Given the trillions of organisms in the microiota, even rare events may be plausible.
- antibiotic gets into the microbiota in several ways.
- > taken orally, some antibiotic is taken up by the gut into the blood early in the gut. However much of the drugs continue throught the gut and the microbiota are exposed.
- > drugs given iv are sometimes removed from the blood by the liver and secreted into the gut as a way for the body to get rid of them. If some is active antibiotic it can then get into the microbiota.
- > in total the excess active antibiotic in the gut does not help treat an infection but has the negative affect of stressing and sometimes killing the microbiome.
- what can be done? If enzymes that detoxify antibiotics can be out into the gut to clean up the unneeded antibiotics, less microbiome will be killed and disrupted and less stress means less resistance.
- I have designer bioengineering that can use helpful organisms making the enzymes breakdown the antibiotics in the right place and right time. The designed organisms can also be probiotics and potentially have beneficial immune boosting properties too.

2. **Preventing bacterial pneumonia** [[Botswana Pneumonia (Kelly)]]

- bacterial pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of severe illness particularly in children. This is despite having many vaccines against leading cause of bacterial pneumonia streptococcus pneumoniae.
- in past studies we have served that there are certain microorganisms that when very abundant in the nose and the throat there are very low levels of streptococcus pneumoniae.
- we've now gone on to find what specific organisms have the ability to inhibit or kill streptococcus pneumoniae.
- we expect that by further investigation we should be able to take some of these new organisms and identify the ones that are the best at safely colonizing the nose of the throat while having protection against not just streptococcus pneumoniae but also additional bacterial pathogens.
- at this stage we have a whole variety of candidate microbes. We know for the medical literature that many of them are completely benign and have rarely if ever been associated with serious disease making them the perfect candidates.
- we also have done a wide variety of screening to identify some of these candidates that have strong properties to inhibit streptococcus pneumoniae.
- we've not yet figured out how these new organisms are inhibiting streptococcus pneumoniae nor have we started to do any animal studies to show that this can happen in animals.

Discussed the several projects above.

I gave realistic timeframes stating that (1) still has a way to go and would probably be a couple years of steady work to get into first in human work. (2) using 'off the shelf' corynebacteria may be able to go into human challenge trials sooner with the proper investment.

We discussed catching up in the** summer 2021** to discuss the status of things at that stage.
