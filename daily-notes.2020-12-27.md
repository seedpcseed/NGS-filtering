# Daily Note

Today is two days after a wonderful Christmas. No doubt a very fine one for sure.

Today was my day to get my new computer from TTitan set up. This means the usual of trying to load key programs and databases that are necessary.

- Programs like: 
  - irfanview
  - inkscape
  - powerdirector
  - screenrecorder
  - wsl 2 
  - **many many** programs for Linux that I need for programming/bioinformatics
- Databases
  - Like the NR files from NCBI for blast
