A Systematic Approach to Identify and Characterize the Effectiveness and Safety of Novel Probiotic Strains to Control Foodborne Pathogens. _Frontiers in Microbiology_, _10_, 1108.

Screening lactobacillus strains (cattle and food sources) for properties to reduce food borne pathogens such as salmonella, campy, listeria, and EHEC

Per their list they consider the following properties

- killing by diffusible products
- adherence
- low cellular toxicity
- antibiotic susceptibility

They do not have assays for immune modulation
