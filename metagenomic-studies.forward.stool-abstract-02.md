### RATIONALE

Racial differences in food allergy (FA) burden exists but it is unclear if differences extend to severity and/or the gut microbiota. This study aims to explore the potential correlation the gut microbiome profile and race and FA severity.

### METHODS

Black and White children (0-12 years old) with a diagnosed FA were enrolled. Parent-proxy responses were obtained for an intake survey (n=588; White \[65%]; Black \[35%]). Among those, stool samples were collected from 196 children with FA. A weighted-12 point severity score developed by FA experts was calculated based on survey data. DNA was extracted from stool samples and shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed. 16S rRNA copies per mg of stool were determined by a Taqman assay and quantitive real-time PCR.

### RESULTS

Significant differences in stool microbial diversity existed by race for Shannon (p=0.01) and observed species (p=0.04). Black participants had higher diversity than White participants. There was not a significant correlation between severity score and microbiome diversity or by race. A significant difference in beta diversity by race was observed (27.4% variation; Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p=0.01; permanova p=0.01). Taxa that were overrepresented in Black participants included Odoribacter (LDA 3.9 Log10, FDR corrected) and Parabacteroides (LDA 3.6 Log10, FDR corrected). A significant correlation between abundance of Odoribacter and severity score among Black participants existed (Pearson’s cor 0.33, p=0.04) but not White participants (Pearson’s cor -0.029, p=0.74).

### CONCLUSIONS

Specific members of the gut microbiota correlate with race and FA severity. Mechanistic studies with these taxa will allow the determination of causal relationships with FA status.

Hi Pat,

Sorry for the delay in response - my grandfather passed away so I was out of the office for a week and a half. 

I tried to submit the abstract the evening it was due but it was not processed due to a glitch in the system. I emailed the conference organizers about the glitch that same evening with the abstract and had a FORWARD team member follow up in my absence. However, the conference organizers ultimately said they couldn't find anything in their system and could not override the glitch so it was not processed at all. 

Attached is what I tried to submit; only had a word limit of 250. We can consider submitting this elsewhere or scrap the abstract and focus on the paper using the detailed summary you sent us. We can discuss with Amal and Maha on our next catch up meeting - I will invite them. 

Thanks for all your work on this, Pat. Really appreciate it. 

Best,
Jia
