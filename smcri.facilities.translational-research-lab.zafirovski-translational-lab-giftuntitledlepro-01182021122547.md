We are extremely grateful to you, Robin and Mike, for providing a gift that included the establishment of the [[Translational Research Laboratory 01182021122537]] (TRL). The TRL will provide state of the art sample analysis from hospitalized children to facilitate faster and better diagnoses, predictive analytics for the disease course, and assessment of therapeutic responses. The ultimate goal of the TRL is to move from research into clinical application. The vision is of clinicians obtaining actionable, rapid clinical information that will improve their management of seriously ill children.

The TRL planning entailed its placement on the 16th floor of the Lurie Children's Hospital immediately adjacent to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unity.  The licensing by the city and state was underway when the pandemic suspended the work. Subsequently the pandemic placed additional constraints on added funding beyond the Zafirovski gift needed to complete the TRL in the original location. 

In the initial plan, the TRL was to be outfitted with equipment for basic sample processing and a state-of-the-art instrument that provides rapid, simple multi-faceted biomarker information from blood samples. However, the pandemic caused challenges for the device manufacturer and also revealed concerning poor customer engagement.

In response to the pandemic-related challenges for the TLR physical space and central instrumentation, Pat Seed revised the plan to move the TLR to the Manne Research Institute in the Simpson-Querrey Building. This location remains quick accessible for testing of clinical samples. The space already has the essential sample processing equipment needed and has the knowledgeable operational management for sophisticated equipment that will be included in the TLR. 

We have also identified ideal equipment for this work. The company Fluidigm makes instrumentation that allows large numbers of samples to simultaneous undergo hundreds of tests using minute volumes of samples such as blood. The platform is exceptionally flexible and user friendly. Combined with products from a company called OLink, we will be able to test hundreds of biomarkers on microliters of blood.  

The original gift included $190,000.  Of this gift, $80,000 was to be applied to the original instrument. The remainder of the gift was intended to support the build of the TLR in the Lurie Children's Hospital. The Fluidigm instrumentation cost is approximately $230,000.  We have purchased the instrument and are having it installed in the Manne Research Institute in January 2021. Our purchase required funding from Pat Seed to cover the full cost of the instrument. ( $230,000 - $80,000 = $150,000). Since we will not require the remainder of the $190,000 gift ( $190,000 - $80,000 = $110,000), we ask if we may apply this remaining support to the cost of the Fluidigm instruments and lessen the support drawn from Dr. Seed's research funding reserves.
