**Proposal**: Unification of infrastructure underlying big data physiology at Lurie, and creation of a Physiological Analytics Core that would coordinate research activities while exploring advanced clinical and quality applications of these technologies in order to develop a kind of physiological precision medicine.

**Objectives**:

I.** Infrastructure**: Unify bedside data collection within a single vendor infrastructure while developing a fully integrated analytics/visualization pipeline that can support research, quality and clinical applications using data from bedside monitors, wireless wearables and asynchronous telemetric sources.

II. **Coordination, collaboration and governance**: Enhance interdisciplinary research networking within Lurie and collaborations with NU researchers with shared interests. Continue governance efforts to guide predictive modeling and clinical decision support as well as bedside technology implementations that span research, clinical and quality applications.

III. **Clinical/quality applications**: Coordinate with clinicians to deploy high-resolution physiological analytics capabilities for situational awareness and decision support. Coordinate alarm rationalization program within Nursing, Clinical Informatics and the Center for Excellence.
