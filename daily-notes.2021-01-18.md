# Martin Luther King's Birthday

I woke up today at 4:30 AM to take the dog out. Not a great night's sleep. Kim asked why I was getting up so early. Felt like I had much to do.  Just busy these days.

I made bread dough yesterday that is now in the fridge. I'm having some motivation issues, however. I can't get myself to leave the desk and go down to set up a loaf to proof and bake.  Maybe in a little bit?

I've been trying to set up a series of bioinformatics today. Much to do to get through the next batch I need to tackle. For the SCRIPT, FORWARD, and HO sets. I keep catching myself up on making a new pipeline. Very preoccupying. Of course it does keep me mentally busy, which is a good thing.

[[Engineered organisms to combat antibiotic resistance]]
what if a bacterium producing an antibiotic degrading enzyme was co-packaged with an antibiotic and encapsulated? if the system was treated with DNase and a cell wall degrading enzyme (like lysozyme? it might then leave the enzyme and antibiotic together? )

\#langston-hughes #poem
I dream a world where man
No other man will scorn,
Where love will bless the earth
And peace its paths adorn
I dream a world where all
Will know sweet freedom's way,
Where greed no longer saps the soul
Nor avarice blights our day.
A world I dream where black or white,
Whatever race you be,
Will share the bounties of the earth
And every man is free,
Where wretchedness will hang its head
And joy, like a pearl,
Attends the needs of all mankind-
Of such I dream, my world!
