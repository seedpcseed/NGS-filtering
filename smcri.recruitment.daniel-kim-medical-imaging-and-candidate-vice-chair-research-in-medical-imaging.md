Wants to establish: Lurie Medical Imaging Research and Innovation Program
Mission: We seek to establish a world-class program strategically focused on pediatric medical imaging research and innovation (PMI-RI) by leveraging and connecting clinical and research resources and human capital existing at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago through leadership. Our goals align with the Lurie Children’s mission, “Research into the prevention, causes, and treatment of diseases that affect children.” As illustrated in Figure 1, our mission is to advance and support the following synergistic activities: innovation, new scientific discovery, training, advocacy, pre-clinical and clinical trials, and patient care.

- Appointment for #cassandra-lucas  and #patcseed to meet with #daniel-kim 
- [ ] Proposal needs to reflect that the Manne Research Institute Supports the whole continuum of research, not just _Basic Science_ (Does Cathy R know this too?) #todo
- [ ] Need clarification on the $2 mill ---> appears to not include student, postdoc, tech. Who are existing individuals for techs (research). Why does this not include the MRI scans ( $50K over 5 years)? 
- [ ] Travel ---> this is not a separate bucket
- [ ] Make faculty hires BOTH with some independent funding ---> costs then need to **include ** their start up.
- [ ] GPU lifespan?  What are additional costs for fiber / connectivity? Is $200K inclusive?
