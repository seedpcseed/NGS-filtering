[[Northwestern Pediatric Physician Scientist Training Program PSTP]]

### PSTP who are currently conducting research OR have developed a research plan for upcoming research (any stage) should prepare answers to the following

1. In about 3 sentences, describe your research (active or planned)
   - What motivates the work?
   - Where are you in the process of planning or doing?
   - Who are your mentors and advisors and what are their respective roles?
2. List the skills you hope to obtain in doing this work.
3. List your strategy for building those skills.
4. Indicate what skills you have started to build and what skills are on your "To Do" list
5. When you get all of these skills, what kind of an expert would you tell someone you are 
6. When you become this expert, describe how you are different than others in your expertise.

Prepared in first year of child neuro training. great start with a number of ideas. Will get honed over time, I'm imagining. I would put the advocacy/educational part around the whole thing.

Currently year 2 of CCM training. The initial statment is good with focus but could be more concise. _ I want to be a pediatric critical care physician and independent investigator with expertise in physiologic signal analysis, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support tools to help guide resuscitation in real-time and improve outcomes in critically ill children._ Would challenge Sarah to add some shading about how much expertise she currently has in each area.

The expert statement is concise, but prognostication of what?  Consider what is your starting point (how much expertise do you have now) towards each skill area. 
![[Mathias_Career Development Plan 2021.pdf]]
Nice concise expert statement. I understand clearly what you want to do.  The expertise areas make sense and have subskills that fit together well.

The expert statement is concise and makes sense. _Pediatric critical care physician & independent scientific investigator with expertise in T cell mediated recovery from viral induced lung injury_.  Is there any component that is developmentally sensitive to highlight another unique perspective you bring to this role?

Thanks for submitting you Venn Diagram. I like the idea of developing translational expertise in inflammatory diseases. Your background in cell bio will probably be a key feature of you as a candidate but may have a lesser role when you are descrbing your skill set that is unique, if you aren't in the future going to be doing the cell bio. In time you'll also look to define the retro and prospective work a little more. Seems like you look to use 'big data' in the EMR to understand risk factors for inflammatory conditions and recovery?  For prospective trials, the expertise is specific too. You can imagine being in early phase work vs. later phase 3 or phase 4 studies, each of which has a specific skill set. There also is implementation science that is prospective in nature. THese are just some considerations as you move forward and hopefully come back to this diagram or some similar organizational framework.

Thanks Dan for your diagram. For the translational work are you seeing yourself doing the development of engineered solutions or doing trials to demonstrate their clinical utility? I like the connection between devices to measure microvascular development and analytics to use the data for diagnosis and prognostication.
