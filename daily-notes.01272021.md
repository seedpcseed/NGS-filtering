# 01272021

So today is another snowy day. We had a number of days of some pretty significant snow coming down that I think accumulated probably the six or seven inches. Our dog blew absolutely loves it and thinks it's the best thing ever. He bounds through the snow and really just stacks like a little puppy. I was going to go downtown to work today but think that I'll end up working at home since the roads are still looking a little bit slick even though they do such a triangle like good job plowing. plus I usually get a lot more done when I'm working here at home and I don't have to do the commute. Just feels a little bit awkward missing Tom shanley's meeting at least being in person although I'll be on a video call.
