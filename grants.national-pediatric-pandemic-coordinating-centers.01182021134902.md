### RFP Pilot Studies Leading to MCHB Application

**RFA NPPCC Pilot Study**

**Purpose:** The National Pediatric Pandemic Coordinating Center (NPPCC) is an incipient consortium. To demonstrate effective cooperation as a discrete entity, we are planning pilot projects involving all five consortium members to highlight the advantages of the consortium structure over individual institutional approaches as preparation for future pandemics affecting children. These activities will validate effective teamwork by the consortium and generate preliminary results for the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) application.

**What projects are appropriate**: Pillars may propose research studies, technology development, quality improvement, information dissemination, or infrastructure activities that advance the goals of the NPPCC as documented in the NPPCC white paper. The proposals should generate contributions to the body of knowledge about COVID19 (i.e., the current pandemic), publishable in a peer-reviewed journal, and supportive of joint grant submissions, including the MCHB application. The ability to achieve partial or near-complete results before submitting our response to the RFA (presumably in the late spring or early summer) will be critical. Therefore, these projects are unlikely to involve prospective multicenter start-up projects that would not deliver meaningful data in less than six months but more likely will use existing samples or data.

**Who can apply:** NPPCC Pillar leaders should submit final applications. Pillar leaders may submit more than one application, and applications may be submitted on behalf of more than one Pillar.

**Application process:**

1) A maximum two-page (0.5-inch margins, 11-font minimum) research statement should include the following:

a. **Title**: proposed research project

b. **Hypothesis and Specific Aims**

c. **Experimental approach**

d. **Future directions**: description of how successful completion of the project will result in the MCHB proposal.

e. **Partnership Plan:** brief description of the collaborative aspect of this application.

f. **References:** _may be included but ARE NOT included in the page count_

**Investigators**: On a single additional cover page, please identify the Principal Investigator (PI) and provide information regarding the identity, qualifications, and contributions of the investigators.

**Budget**: The budget (up to $50,000) should be annotated on an additional page, including justifications using PHS 398 Form Page 4 (Rev. 03/20). Allowable expenses include salaries and fringe benefits for other personnel (e.g., post-doctoral fellow; research technician) contributing to the project; supplies/small equipment required for the project; consulting costs for statistical and informatics support; charges to utilize equipment/core services necessary for this project. Faculty salaries and indirect costs are not allowed. Although not essential, it would be easiest to allocate funds if they are divided among the five centers and avoid subcontracts the requirement for subcontracts.

**Submission:** All applications must be submitted electronically by February 15, 2021 to Mark Batshaw ([mbatshaw@childrensnational.org](mailto:mbatshaw@childrensnational.org)).

**Review Process**: Review will be conducted by the five scientific leaders of the collaborating institutions (Eric Tham, Tom Curran, Pat Seed, Mitch Cohen, and Mark Batshaw). Each proposal will receive an impact score (using the NIH scoring system) reflecting the merit. All submitted applications will be reviewed, and applicants will be provided with de-identified proposal reviews.

**Funding Plan**: Awards will be funded for 6 months for up to $50,000 and two proposals will be funded. The funding dates will be March 01, 2021 â€“ September 30, 2021.
