#Blue and I got going at 5 AM today (a little later than usual) and walked the beach path in #Evanston by the house. Was quiet. That strange situation right after #Christmas where the holiday lights and all probably hadn't really changed but something seems diffferent. I often also have this same feelign that I missed the holiday in someway.  Of course I didn't but it just goes by very fast. I will say that, reflecting on the holiday, it was a good one. Good spirits in our whole family. We had some interactive #Zoom calls consider that the #pandemic with #COVID19 has kept us all apart. 

On service today in the hospital #Ann-and-Robert-H-Lurie-Childrens-Hospital . I'm actually on the #general-peds-ID service for today and tomorrow.  Looks pretty busy for the holiday time but fairly straightforward cases, it appears. It will keep me busy for much of the day but nothing too bad I suppose.  Will be nice getting a ride from #ravi-jhaveri to and from the hospital. He is also on service and the #Northwestern shuttle is not running today.

I'm also trying to get more analysis done today on a number of #metagenomics projects. Always a lot to do for sure. I do love running these jobs on my new #Titan computer. The thing is a total beast and I love it!
