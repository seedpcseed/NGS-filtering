### Email chain describing the problem
We have a very confusing problem.  The test results are much more frequent than would be expected, and they are widely discordant.  We ran three assays on 47 samples.  Results attached.

 

·         Allplex in Seed lab

o    3 targets (E, RdRp, N)

o    Positive is any single target positive at Ct<40

o    31 (66%) were positive, 18 (58%) of which only 1 target (all RdRp)

o    Kits are expired

·         CDC assay in Hultquist lab

o    Two N gene target assay, although Hultquist lab runs one target because of issues with the second target

o    CDC defines positive as either target < 40, but Hultquist lab finds values 35-40 are not reliably positive

o    Assay ran in duplicate

o    3 amplified < 35 on both duplicates (2 were sibling remote learners, the other student was positive for all three targets by the Allplex but negative on the m2000)

o    4 amplified >35 on both duplicates

o    10 amplified with only one target, all > 35

·         Abbott m2000 done in clinical micro (only 43 ran because of batching)

o    2 targets (N, RdRp)- result provides one Ct value but unclear which gene it reports

o    Package insert does not state whether positive is any gene positive or both

o    17 were positive (41% of the 41 samples that passed QC), only one with lower CT value than the internal control (1000 copies/ml)

 

Discordance also noted:

NTL158 and NTL159 (both remote students, siblings) positive on all assays but discordance otherwise pervasive

NTL0049 positive 3 targets on allplex, both CDC targets < 35, but neg on m2000

 

Hultquist lab also ran the CDC N gene PCR assay on the 67 samples from the second school.  We have not yet done any validation with another assay.

·         2 amplified < 35

·         1 amplified amplified >35 on both duplicates

·         8 amplified with only one target, all > 35

 

I am at a loss here about what to do and how to interpret this and how to report.   I should point out that Hultquist lab has on multiple occasions failed to amplify SARS-CoV-2 from samples we have sent them that were positive on m2000.  We are out of sample to do additional testing.

If run Allplex first, who need to reconfirm 13 with other assay
If run CDC would need to reconfirm 12 with other assays
If run triplicate or quad with hulquist lab, probably few needed validation
