Hi all,

I’m delighted to mention that we at Lurie Children’s are going to apply as a subawardee of PEDSnet/CHOP in the new round of PCORnet infrastructure funding that PCORI has announced.  This one is “PCORnet 3.0,” with a project period that begins in August 2021.

This exciting step builds upon our burgeoning work with PEDSnet in these dimensions:

- technical and data development (credit: George Lales, who is our most valuable player, assisted greatly by Mark Bennett)
- scientific and grant-writing (Anne Berg, PhD, Sandi Lam, MD, Joyce Wu, MD, Ravi Jhaveri, MD, Priya Verghese, MD, and Ram Ramgopal, MD, and more)
- strategic and administrative (all of you on this email, plus others in Lurie Children’s)

Having participated this fall/winter in a bunch of PEDSnet meetings and activities (e.g., as a review committee member for the PEDSnet Scholars program), I am pleased to report that PEDSnet is a thoughtful, organized, strategic, talented, and principled network.  The atmosphere is collegial.  The faculty and the staff are happy.

While we no longer will be a PCORnet infrastructure subaward site of Capricorn/NU, we will continue to be good neighbors and could participate in research projects with Capricorn/NU on a case-by-case basis.  The PCORnet umbrella and its common data model make it relatively efficient to do that.  E.g., in Anne and Sandi’s funding application (which is under just-in-time review), we collaborated not only with PEDSnet but also with sites from four other PCORnet subnetworks across the nation, including the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, Nicklaus Children’s in Miami, and others.

The general idea that PCORnet 3.0 will bring some realignment of the sites across the PCORnet subnetworks is understood and is anticipated by both PCORI and NU.  PCORI has mentioned it in meetings.  And NU mentioned in a January Capricorn meeting that NU is hoping that one or two midwestern PCORnet sites (from the “Greater Plains Collaborative”) will subcontract with Capricorn rather than with Greater Plains, in PCORnet 3.0.

I'll let Dr. Abel Kho and the central Capricorn group know that we at Lurie Children’s will be joining PEDSnet/CHOP’s application to PCORnet 3.0.  I’ll make clear that we at Lurie Children's also would collaborate with Capricorn on new research projects, whenever appropriate.

I’m thankful for all of your support.  And I’m thankful that Stanford is joining PEDSnet at the same time -- we two are PEDSnet’s first expansion beyond its original cohort of eight.  This fortunate timing has led to excellent collaboration with Grace Lee, MD, MPH, of Stanford, on the onboarding of our two sites.

best regards,

marc
