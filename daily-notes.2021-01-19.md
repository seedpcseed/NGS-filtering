Today is the day after a nice #martin-luther-king day holiday. 

Working today on a number of catch up items 

- planning for smcri restructuring
- metagenomics analysis 
  - getting containers and databases in a place where they are automatically downloaded and run
- [[HMI3 01192021120408]] lunch and learn
  - lack of antibiotic exposure and still increasing resistance
  - antibiotic resistance is coupled with other microbial physiology like carbon utilization

Thoughts and ideas

- thinking about a method to 'unpackage' bacteria like e coli that are making antibiotic resistance enzymes like beta lactams. The idea is that antibiotic and e coli could be co-packaged with 'timed' release of the enzyme to metabolize e coli
- thoughts are things like bromelain or specific phage lysis factors (T7?)

- follow up with fluidigm rep about training #todo
- [ ] make training time with O link #todo
- [ ] correct signed letter dates for Kendra #todo
- [ ] set up training for prospector
