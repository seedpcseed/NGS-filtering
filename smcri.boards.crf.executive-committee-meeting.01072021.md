The translational research is reduced as we have been able to do much of that work through research awards and developing the innovation program (with ready support).  

The research awards has and will be an important and notable investment by CRF that allows Manne Investigators to pivot towards emerging and unmet problems

The reseach informatics and research informatics relates to a key priority to start building our analytic capabilities where we have lagged.
