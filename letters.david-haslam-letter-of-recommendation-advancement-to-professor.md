RE: David Haslam, MD, Promotion to Professor of Clinical-AFF within the Department of Pediatrics

Dear Dr. Spearman,

I am pleased to provide this letter in support of Dr. David Haslam's promotion to Professor of Clinical-AFF within the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati.  I believe Dr. Haslam has made multiple contributions that warrant strong consideration of this promotion: 1) Research on the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and metagenomics to predict risk of invasive infections, and 2)  Clinical program development and service related to antimicrobial stewardship.

With regard to research contributions, Dr. Haslam's CV cites fifty nine original, peer-reviewed publications. His work includes early studies on the structure-function relaetionships and mechanisms of adherence by _E. coli_ in the  urinary tract. These studes such as Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 91(25): 11889-11893 and Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 91(25): 11889-11893 directly influeced my subsequent studies on the molecular pathogenesis of urinary tract infections where my laboratory identified mechanisms through which _E. coil_ gains access to the uroepithelium and undergoes intracellular replication.

Dr. Haslam subsequently developed a strong research program in bacterial toxin trafficking and function.  Notable articles from this work include Nat Chem Biol. 5(3): 157-165, Infect Immun. 73(4): 2524-2532,  Infect Immun. 75(9): 4552-4561, and PLoS Pathog 8(12): e1003072. These good to high impact articles made fundamental contributions to understanding the function and impact on pathogenesis of shiga, cholera, and _C. difficile_ toxins.  The impact is reflected by 197,  149, 100, and 107 citations, respectively.  His more recent article J Clin Invest. May 1;130(5):2377-2390 formed the basis of teaching to my Pediatric Infectious Disease fellows regarding the role of age and host response in _C. difficile_ clinical outcomes.  

In the most current work, Dr. Haslam focuses on microbiome and metagenomics to understand the risk for invasive infection in children and to support a range of additional studies of microbiome-host interactions. While Dr. Haslam is a contributing author for most of these scholarly products, this science often requires substantial team effort for which his contributions are distinguish through his expertise in the microbiome and technology for its evaluation in clinical samples.  Work such as The Journal of Immunology 204 (1 Supplement), 231.23-231.23, Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. Sep;26(9):1704-1710.PMID: 32505810, and Nature. Oct;586(7827):108-112 have been influential for the work of myself and my collaborators where we also have interest in the microbiome as a pathogen reservoir and modulator of phenotypes such as obesity. In total, Dr. Haslam's important scholarly contributions support his h-index of 27 (i10-index of 44). 

Dr. Haslam's scholarly contributions undewrite his national and international reputation. Notable recognitions include past March of Dimes Basil O'Connor and Burroughs Wellcome Foundation awards. Related to his metagenomics/microbiome studies, recent invited speakerships have been from the IDSA, ASM, and Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto for grand rounds. Dr. Haslam continues to have co-investigatory research from extramural sources including the NIH and CDC.

Dr. Haslam assumed the role of Director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship program at CCHCM. In my review of his personal statement, this program under his leadership appears to have produced substantial reduction in anti-microbial use and has included the institution of technological supports to automate human-assisted consultations for anti-microbial use. From the personal statement, it appears that Dr. Haslam's contribution has been substantial and his constant availability to work with clinicians to manage antimicrobial use is remarkable. From the information I have I cannot comment on the impact on clinical outcomes.  The work of the ASM program also appears to leverage Dr. Haslam's knowledge of bacterial genomics and metagenomics well where use of this knowledge and associated technology has led to substantial molecular epidemiology to define intra-institutional infection agent transmission. The impact of th ASM program appears to be primarily local without much dissemination of innovations to other institutions or through publicaitons or presentations.

My review of Dr. Haslam's teaching is more limited. I can comment on my personal distant experience. I was a Pedatric Infectious Diseases fellow while Dr. Haslam was an Assistant Professor at Washington University. At that time, his teaching of fellows and residents was very good. Since that time, I can only comment on informatino from the personal statement and CV.  His teaching activities appear to be appropriate but standard for any practicing faculty member.

Overall, Dr. Haslam provides substantial contributions in the areas of scholarship and antimicrobial stewardship.  Thank you for the opportunity to support Dr. Haslam's portfolio for promotion. Please contact me with additional questions or information.
