# Book One

.Ahrens, Sonke. 2017. How to Take Smart Notes. North Charleston, SC: Createspace Independent Publishing Platform. 

Overall, this book summarizes keep points of reading and organizing ideas largely base on the practices of Luhmann

### Top down vs Bottom up development of ideas and supporting arguments

One point did emphasis is the bottom up approach of writing. Letting ideas move into relationships and start to mold to one another. This is different than the top down approach the may have a goal or hypothesis at the outset. Athens raises the point that the top down approach is more likely to lead to #confirmation-bias than a bottom up approach. This really sticks with me and relate much to this :bulb:

### Reading to understand

"Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it."

Important points for note taking include writing the main concepts of the ideas and the bibliographic information. Several psychologists show that this is more effective than a stream of quotes from what is read. Ahrens describes this as the step from fleeting to permanent notes that go into the slipbox. Permanent notes are not first drafts but are derivations of fleeting notes.

Feyman insists that writing is not documenting thoughts. It is working the thoughts. It is a necessary externalization of what most people consider as internalized intellectual activities.

### Cramming vs comprehension

Some are plaques with remembering too mich and too well. Important ideas can become buried for them so that they cannot pull out, focus, and comprehend the ideas that are most important
