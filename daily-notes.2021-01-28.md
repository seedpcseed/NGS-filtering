Today was a bit of a rough day. Was not happy at all with Felix's performance yesterday on a qPCR assay. It is a study of COVID-19 spread in chicago schools. It is a study that is particularly important since the results are supposed to be returned to the schools and parents. Yet he did a really lousy job with poor reproducibility and without reviewihg the data before going home and realizeing that the job was not done properly and to the standard I expect. This now has felt like na onoing issue and I'm getting to the end of my rope.
