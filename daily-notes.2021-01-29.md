## today's thoughts

Started today with an urgent call from Larry Kociolek who was sweating this COVID-19 study we're doing in schools. We are doing PCR assays to detect the virus in school children who are having in person studies. The assays were all over the place and there was an obligation to report results. We didn't want to call a crazy number of assays positive and have the schools closed and the study ![](image/daily-notes.2021-01-29/1612025927696.png)shutdown. Fortunately we had a lot of validation assays and were able to get to what we think is near truth. Certainly something that shouldn't cause harm to anyone involved and will help those who we think are truly positive.

We're expecting up to 8 inches of snow tonight and tomorrow! #snow

Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
