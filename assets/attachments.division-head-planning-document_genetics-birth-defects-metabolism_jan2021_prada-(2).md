| **Clinical and Quality Improvement Initiatives** | There is a need to hire more genetic faculty in the division to expand current and new services and to reduce the wait time for new patients (current wait time is 4 to 6 months?)                 There are already established successful programs in the division with strong track record of clinical trials and management outcomes                                 There are eager collaborators interested in genomics in several specialties across institution including cardiology, ophthalmology, neurology, and oncology.                           Telehealth services are now widely accepted due to COVID19 and patient satisfaction is high in many settings.                   Biochemical Genetics laboratory services | We will recruit:  4 MD clinical genetics faculty and support staff including equal numbers of NP, GC, and RN.   1 Physician scientist will also be a priority as we increase clinical capacity to develop new services and research innovation.   Expansion of nutrition services to other genetic disorders including mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and others.  1 additional social worker to continue providing support to families and patients.    We will identify new programs and patient cohorts that will benefit from the model of treatment based clinics and multidisciplinary management. This will then lead to clinical trials and new opportunities for growth and direct patient care benefit. The goal is to be ahead of industry and engage pharma and others before they come to us.  Expand translational collaborations with basic scientists in the Stanley Manne research institute.                       We will facilitate genomic testing across institution by developing a precision genomic program across all divisions at Lurie. This will involve physicians within each specialty that have a strong understanding of genetics. This group will be instrumental in creating physician champions in genomics from different backgrounds and quickly identify areas of need for the institution. This team will meet monthly and discuss implementation of genomic initiatives and integrate with laboratory services at Lurie Childrenâ€™s. The goal of the group will aim to help children and their parents to have an earlier diagnosis and identify potential therapeutic options. This group could also become a resource for patients planning to visit Lurie Childrenâ€™s for second opinions or management of complex disorders when no other group has an established program at Lurie. This also opens opportunity for telemedicine approaches in various settings.   We will plan to facilitate and continue expanding telemedicine services for patient care. This approach has been well received in genetics with good satisfaction compared to in person visits. We will identify other institutions/hospitals and community partnerships interested in access to genomic services.              We will establish laboratory as the leading center for metabolic disease testing in the city. | Strong institutional investment in genomics to compete with other institutions and become the leading genetic center in the Midwest. At this stage Lurie Childrenâ€™s has well established cohorts for selected disorders (NF1, PKU, and lysosomal storage diseases) which can attract established experts and researchers or be an opportunity to train young faculty to become the next generation experts. This model is the future of genetics and needs to expand to other disease pathways such as RASopathies,e eye genetic, and others to continue building programs that will create opportunities for therapeutics and management.   Requested positions for the first 5 years of program: 4 MD â€“ 4 NPs â€“ 4 GCs â€“ 4 RNs â€“ 1 RDs â€“ 1 SW 1 MD physician scientist  Protected time for MD educational training programs  We will develop a RAS pathway clinical program to non-NF1 related RASopathies (> 15 different diagnosis). This program focuses on the management of a group of syndromes, collectively called â€˜RASopathiesâ€™, which are caused by germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the Ras- mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Mutations in each RAS-MAPK pathway gene result in unique patient phenotypes. However, because all the syndromes deregulate the same signaling pathway, many phenotypic features overlap and patients may be treated best in a multi-disciplinary center. This allows to plan for clinical trials and become the lead center in management for these disorders. I have already established clinical and basic collaborations for this set of disorders.   Based on the success of this model, then we will continue developing new pathway based programs. Clinical and research faculty recruitment (already described above) Identify key collaborators across divisions (other divisions at Lurie) Program coordinator effort (this can be share with other clinical programs based on volumes) The program will be well integrated with research capabilities (database, outcomes, utilization of services, QI projects) Multi-disciplinary approach   Identify key physician champions with genomic expertise within each division at Lurie Childrenâ€™s. Effort time could be negotiated with each division or if faculty has already time assigned/interest in this type of initiative the creation of program will help maximize those goals.  Program coordinator (shareable with other initiatives).  Identification of external division faculty and protected time for program (effort time covered by their own division/institution) Business and marketing support  This program can also help identify individuals that qualify for clinical trials or novel therapeutic approaches. This will increase reputation and genomic visibility of Lurie Childrenâ€™s.  Integration with pathology to develop testing capacity and specific clinical needs of proposed molecular studies. Continue building relation with pathology at Institution  Genetic counselors will continue to be involved following current model of collaboration across institution and identifying new opportunities.   Developing a team within the division interested in participating in telegenetic services. We will develop a model to considerate patient/family friendly hours. This will also help solve issues with clinical space for patient visits as we increase provider capacity.  Scheduling capabilities Negotiate flexible hours for staff involve in this program to facilitate sustainability of program Consider direct to consumer services and GC independent programs Second opinions for rare diseases (using precision genomics group as core) Lab utilization - GC services to external institutions  Business development/marketing support  **I will need to know more about current institutional resources and capacity for this type of effort.**   We will expand portfolio of services in collaboration with pathology â€“ (I believed this is already a joint effort). This will need a PhD in clinical mass spectrometry and mass spec technicians to develop new testing capabilities (if already available no need for hiring). Marketing services to other institution and business development plan to build relations and increase testing volume. This can go hand on hand with telemedicine development efforts. PhD recruitment for lab Mass spectrometry techs Business development/marketing support Protected time for lab interpretation from clinical biochemical directors MDs  **I will need to know visit metabolic labs and know more about current test offering  to better allocate resources to this effort** |
| **Education and Training**                       | Multiple division members stated interest in being part of a genetics training program. There is no medical genetics program in Chicago.       Increase genetics lectures in hospital and specialty groups       CME programs within division for faculty and staff    Quality improvement projects for utilization of services and therapies      There is a need to develop international training opportunities with other training sites                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | We will start application to develop a training program for genetics and biochemical genetics at Lurie Childrenâ€™s to train the new generation of geneticists.       Precision genomics lecture series to increase education, training, and understanding of benefits and limitation of genetic technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics.    Identify CME and other opportunities to maintain program updates and encourage practice improvements  Routinely evaluate performance and utilization of resources for diagnostics and therapeutics in the division      Developing international collaborations to have international students visiting Lurie Childrenâ€™s program and vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Protected time for program director â€“ this could be an area of interest for recruitment of new faculty â€“ this will be a priority for the division director. 20% protected time for program director 5% teaching time for faculty involved in the program Goal: 1 to 2 fellows per year   Mix of internal and external speakers - case based discussion within specialties â€“ encourage divisional members to take lead in many of these initiatives. 30K yearly funds to support activities and invitation of external speakers   Participation in local, national, and international meetings.

Increase # of trials to new disorders exploiting key internal collaborations (eye genetics and others). Retention of patients that are coming for trials and want to stay for clinical care at Lurie Childrenâ€™s (need to match well trials with capacity and clinical expertise proposed in previous goals) 

- Build infrastructure for cohort building for rare diseases Development of an institutional genomic repository and _biobanking Internal seed grant program_ to develop new partnerships around genomics in the institution 


- Goal to develop _new animal models to study RASopathy syndromes_ for future preclinical testing. **Researcher** would work closely with Dr. Prada in the division of Genetics and Metabolism to develop unified basic and translational research goals for RASopathies.

- Protected time for principal investigators to allow training and trial supervision. 

- Increase percentage effort of PI allocated to clinical trials â€“ this should be an institutional investment since it will lead to better run trials and likely more industry offers of future trials. 

- Develop teams of principal investigators and clinical research coordinators to maximize opportunities CRC support based on trial needs Extra-CRC availability to not miss opportunities (this could be part of an institutional initiative and shared resource across divisions) 

- Collaborate with bioinformatics to develop pipelines for patient identification Data mining capabilities (Is this an existing resource at Lurie?) This will position Lurie Childrenâ€™s for future large genomic initiatives, investigator initiated research, partner with other institutions and industry 

- Dedicated team for biobanking and CRC team to enroll participants Recruitment of a director and staff for this initiative This needs to be integrated with all clinical programs at Lurie This will become an institutional resource for all investigators Develop a committee and fund for 5 years to evaluate internal applications in an R21 format to select 3 grants of 100K each year. The goal is to do internal match-making of clinician and basic scientists teams to develop new genomic programs at Lurie and evaluate conversion to funded extramural awards. 

- This program will also help increase exposure and education in genomics to all faculty. Program coordinator 1.2M for grant awards Committee will be the previously described precision genomics team Recruitment of a research faculty with this expertise to partner with my clinical and translational efforts _$ 2M research recruitment package Faculty salary and personnel (2 postdocs, 1 RA) Animal core, equipment, lab costs_

- space based on qualifications ---> suggest that this is R01 funded person

- Co-recruitment with  HMGP scientist study pre-clinical models of RASopathy. Expect to be an independently funded individual If not recruited in first 2 years, will work with HMGP and CRO to recruit another human genetics modeling scientist $2 mill

- Co- recruitment with HMGP and Neuroscience for Assoc Professor min with independent funding in genetics of neurological diseases, ideally seizure do $2 mill

- Co-recruitment with HMGP and Neuroscience for Assist or Associ Professor with independent funding and working on genetic basis of behavioral development / do $2 mill

-  recommend 2 x $75 year for 3 years  -->> through PEERS --->>> consider combined investment with current neo- genetics collaborative

- biobanking through pathology -->> funded through grant mechanism, existing funding, and extramural support
  - Support through director of biobanking
  - CRC support through clinical trials with division associated individuals

- bioinformatics through Sabah and her team
  - Plans to hire master's level individual for bioinformatics support in genomics
