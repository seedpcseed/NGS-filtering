Dear Dr. Davis,

Thank you for inviting me to share with you a list of some of the equipment I
currently use in my laboratory. I am listing these instruments with cost
estimate for your consideration. This may include equipment that you already
have in your labs or research institute. These instruments are necessary for
various measurements in clinical research studies and for laboratory specimen
preparation and analyses.

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT

1. Thermo Fisher Savant SpeedVac™ Vacuum Concentrators. Universal vacuum system
(uvs800DA). Cost ~ \\$33,000-\\$40,000

Centrifugal vacuum concentration is a unique method used for removing solvents
from samples to concentrate or dry biological and non-biological materials,
residues, solutes and analytes, for qualitative and quantitative analysis
(chemical, biochemical, bioassay, immunoassay, and instrumental methods).

2. Centrivap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator. Cost- \\$5,495

This is designed to rapidly concentrate multiple small samples using centrifugal
force, vacuum and heat.

3. Beckman J-6 B Centrifuge. Cost-\\$ 20,000

The Beckman J6B is a high capacity refrigerated floor centrifuge, with an
advanced refrigeration option, a performance speed of 6000 rpm, and a maximum
force of 6835 g.

4. MAGPIX Multiplex Automated Immunoassay Reader XMAP. Vendor- Millipore. Cost-
\\$30,000

This instrument is capable of multiplexing up to 50 analytes per sample. This
flow-based bead reader is sensitive to single digit picogram levels of protein,
and can screen more than 40 analytes in a single sample using as little as 25
μl. Used for measurement of inflammatory markers and other biomarkers.

5. Fisher Scientific Education Analytical balance-Capacity 200g. Cost ~ 5,000

6. Fisher Scientific Isotemp 500 series Economy lab ovens ~\\$2,000-4,000.

7. Fisher Scientific Isotemp Digital and Analog Dry Bath Incubators
~2,000-4,000

8. Cobas e 411 analyzer-Roche. Cost ~\\$125,000

The cobas e 411 is a benchtop analyzer for immunoassays for immunological
analysis of serum or plasma. It offers novel Electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
technology which provides superior analytical performance. Used from measurement
of insulin, C-peptide, vitamin D and other hormones of interest.

9. Synergy HTXMulti-Mode Reader. SynergyH1M; Vendor- Biotek. Cost-\\$37,135

This Microplate Reader is a compact system for 6- to 384-well microplates for
UV-Vis absorbance, fluorescence, luminescence; with Gen5 Software for data
collection, analysis, and reporting.

10. Refrigerated and non-refrigerated Legend Mach 1.6 Centrifuge- Thermo Fisher.
Cost-\\$5,325

11. Glucose YSI Analyzer: used for bedside measurement of blood glucose and
other analytes during the clamp studies. Cost ~\\$16,000.

12. Vmax Encore System (CareFusion Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA), The Vmax
Encore System can be used for the measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2),
carbon dioxide production (VCO2), respiratory quotient (RQ) and energy
expenditure during rest and exercise in the breath-by-breath or mixing chamber
and dilution mode. Cost -\\$44,164.

13. Freezer cost: -70 degrees freezer is used for storage of specimens until
analyses and for future use as more discoveries can lead to new hypotheses. Cost
~ \\$10,000-15,000

14. EndoPAT (Itamar Medical): a machine for non-invasive peripheral vascular
measures. Cost -\\$30,000.

15. Shygmacor: This device is utilized to measure pulse wave velocity in medium
sized arteries non-invasively. -\\$29,500

OTHER RESOURCES

Availability of a metabolic research unit for outpatient and inpatient studies
with necessary equipment and accommodation of overnight stays.

Isotope preparation unit or Investigational pharmacy support.

Mass spectrometry unit for derivatization and measurement of stable isotope
enrichment in blood specimen.

Body composition measurements and High Resolution peripheral quantitative
Compute tomography (HRpQCT) for assessment of bone microarchitecture.

Radiology: imaging for abdominal and liver fat determination.

I am looking forward to ongoing conversations and exploring research
possibilities at Lurie Children’s.

Sincerely,

Fida
