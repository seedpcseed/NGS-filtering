# #R-Metaflow

\#R #metagenomics 

_Purpose_: to create workflow in R (where I best like programming and analysis) to process metagenomics sequencing.

1. I'm using the R system drake  for a directed acrylic graph #dag
2. I have created a system of config.R, rules.R, functions.R, packages.R etc that appears pretty straightforward.  I do not yet have any sort of help system for it yet.
