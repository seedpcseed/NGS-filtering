Woke up today with a bad headache and feeling like I hadn't slept. Probably work stress and alcohol. I'm going to try to drop alcohol for 2 weeks to see where I stand. I know in the past that has helped so much to purge and feel better. Also is an exact driver of weight gain.

Today is the inauguration of #Joe-Biden and #Kamala-Harris. That is exciting and desperately needed. Last night the two couples met at the reflecting pool lined with 400 lights representing 1,000 people each who died of COVID. Very understated but powerful. Biden made a short speech, but the acknowledgment of so many deaths was a good start.  He stated that we have to remember to heal. Seems like wisdom to me.
